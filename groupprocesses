"How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?"

During the inception of assignment 2, our group ensured that we collectively establish a medium of communication that we all find practical
to use. We all decided on upon Facebook Messenger, as accounts of for this service was something all 6 of has respectively possessed, and
is also a service that we all visit regularly. This medium has remained the status quo for communication for assignment 3, as it performed
as expected for the group previously.

As well as online communication, during Intro to Information Technology tutorials, all members of our group aim to attend, as well as sit
together during the class so we can continue to establish seamless communication in real life - which is a important skill to build for
similiar group projects within real-world companies. None of our team members have encountered any unshakeable differences which have
impacted the production of our work, which is a very redeemable aspect in such an environment. Everyone views the work professionally, and
as we all possess the same motivation - to create the best work and achieve the best mark as possible - is it unlikely that any of
us with encounter any relevant personal differences during the simple incpetion of this assignment which will overshadow that 
determination.

As the content for assignment 3 doesn't stray too far from that of assignment 2, the group collectively does not intend to change any of
these communication mediums, as we are pleased with the previous results of them. The longer we spend working with one another, the more
we learn to respect each other, as well as learn what each of us are best at in terms of the assignment content. This has made the role
delegation process very streamlined, and allows us to complete our respectively work on our own, and open to seeking help from 
fellow team members if need be.
